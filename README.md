# EmpowerIDTest

Implementation notes

- The API is temporarily hosted at https://185.51.62.152:8087/api/
- Client part was tested on Windows/MacOS and Android
- Android UI could use some improvements in terms of font sizes, layout etc
- Unit tests are very basic, just to show the idea

# The original task description

## Task: Employee Management System
Build a web application that allows an organization to manage its employees. The application should have the following features:

1.	Employee List: Display a list of all employees with details such as name, email, date of birth, and department.
2.	Add Employee: Allow the user to add a new employee to the list.
3.	Edit Employee: Allow the user to edit an existing employee's details.
4.	Delete Employee: Allow the user to delete an employee from the list.
5.	Search Employees: Allow the user to search for employees by name, email, or department.
6.	REST API: The application should also have a REST API that allows clients to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the employee data.
7.	LINQ: Use LINQ to retrieve data from the database and display it in the Employee List.

## Technology Stack:
- XAML, Avalonia, and optionally other technologies such as .NET MAUI/UNO Framework
- C# as the programming language
- Entity Framework Core for data access
- SQL Server as the database

## Notes:
- The focus should be on demonstrating a strong understanding of C#, REST, LINQ, and XAML/Avalonia/Maui.
- The user interface can be simple and straightforward, the emphasis is on functionality.
- You can use an in-memory database for simplicity.
- Please add unit tests.
- Please share the code in a publicly accessible GitHub repo and a link to the running app
- You will be asked to use the Upwork time recorder tool for this task only.
- All candidates will receive 5 star ratings so this task will not have any negative effects.
